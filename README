qiafph -- Qiafph Is A Four Part Harmonizer

Written by William Hatch

Qoafph is written in C and can be built by running "make".
It only depends on standard C libraries for building.

Qiafph is mostly configured in source.  Edit rulescores.h to change rule weights.
Qiafph outputs Midge format files.  These can be converted to MIDI using Midge.
Find Midge at http://www.undef.org.uk/code/midge/.  It's a perl script, so you'll need perl to run it.

Alternatively it can output MuseData output, but that section is currently commented out.
I switched to Midge because MuseData gave weird results sometimes.

MIDI files can be played with many players, eg. Timidity, and imported into Musescore for viewing the sheet music.

Qiafph options can be viewed by running 'quiafph --help'

Also included is midig.sh, a convenient wrapper script that uses qiafph and midge to generate .mg, .mid, and a .a analysis file (it's just text)
